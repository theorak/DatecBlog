Users can comment by using the form, public users enter their username and email-address, logged-in users have this form prefilled. Logged-in backend users can ignore that and will just appear as the user creating this comment. The 'reply' button after each comment will add this comment as a reference to the form (see text in screenshot) and can be removed by clicking the reference. This form is spam protected with an internal check.
